 * answer — that's fragile against proxies, mobile networks, and

 * returns 202 immediately once payment is confirmed, and the caller polls
 * GET /oracle/:jobId (or listens on its SSE stream) for the result.
 *
 * States: awaiting_workers -> reconciling -> settled
 * `settled` always carries an `outcome` of 'resolved' or 'refunded' — same
 * fail-closed guarantee as before, just observed asynchronously.

 * store.incr() is the same atomic primitive the rate limiter relies on
 * (see store.js's MemoryStore.incr for why it has to be atomic), reused
